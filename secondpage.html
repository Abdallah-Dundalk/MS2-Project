       <h1>How to Play</h1>
       <p>This game consists of 9 buttons, each button surronded with two rings, an inner and outer ring. The goal of the game is to rotate each ring until it aligns with the direction indicated by the arrow on the the button at the center of the rings. Also, the ring that is aligned to the direction of the button, must match the colour. So if the button is red and pointing right, you must align the red ring so that its arrow is facing the buttons arrow. You can only move one ring at a time. You must toggle between controlling the red or blue rings by pressing the toggle button which will chnage colour to indicate which colour ring you have activated and can now control. If the button is purple, you must align both the red and the blue ring to the buttons arrow. If both rings have the same alignment to teh buttons arrow, but the buttons colour is not purple, the orientation of the rigns is not correct and no points are scored. When teh rings are correctly aligned, the button will change green and you will score 1000 pts. When all buttons are green, you have won. You must turn all buttons green before the timer runs out. You have 60 seconds to win the game. If the timer runs out, you lose. To play, simply press "Start" and have fun! </p>
